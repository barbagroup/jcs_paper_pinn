In our work, we strive for reproducibility of the results, and all the code we have used is available under an open-source license, while all the data is available in open archival repositories.
Readers may reproduce the figures in this paper using the code and data available via the GitHub repository for this paper, located at \url{https://github.com/barbagroup/jcs_paper_pinn/} and archived in Zenodo. 
If readers do not want to rerun the solutions, but still want to be able to re-create the figures, they may find raw data generated with the PINN solver and the traditional CFD solver in a separate Zenodo deposit.
