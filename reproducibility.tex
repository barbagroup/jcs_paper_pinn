In our work, we strive for achieving reproducibility of the results, and all the code we developed for this research is available publicly on GitHub under an open-source license, while all the data is available in open archival repositories.
PetIBM is an open-source CFD library based on the immersed boundary method, and is available at \url{https://github.com/barbagroup/PetIBM} under the BSD-3 license. 
The software was peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Open Source Software \cite{chuang_petibm_2018}. 
Our PINN solvers based on the NVIDIA \emph{Modulus} toolkit can be found following the links in the GitHub repository for this paper, located at \url{https://github.com/barbagroup/jcs_paper_pinn/}. 
There, the folder prefixed by \texttt{repro-pack} corresponds to a git submodule pointing to the relevant commit on a branch of the repository for the full reproducibility package of the first author's PhD dissertation \cite{chuang_thesis_2023}.
As described in the README of the repro-pack, readers can use pre-generated data for plotting the figures in this paper, or they can re-run the solutions using the code and data available in the repro-pack.
The latter option is of course limited by the computational resources available to the reader.
To facilitate reproducibility of the computational environment, we ran all cases using a Docker container for PetIBM (which we ran in a lab workstation), and Singularity/Apptainer images for the PINN cases (which ran in a remote cluster). 
All the container recipes are included in the repro-pack under the \texttt{resources} folder. 
The \emph{Modulus} toolkit was open-sourced by NVIDIA in March 2023,\footnote{\url{https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/physics-ml-platform-modulus-is-now-open-source/}} under the Apache License 2.0.
This is a permissive license that requires preservation of copyright and license notices and provides an express grant of patent rights. 
When we started this research, \emph{Modulus} was not yet open-source, but it was publicly available through the conditions of an End User Agreement. 
Documentation of those conditions can be found via the May 21, 2022, snapshot of the \emph{Modulus} developer website on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine.\footnote{\url{https://web.archive.org/web/20220521223413/https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/modulus/containers/modulus}}
