Readers may reproduce the figures in this paper using the code and data available via the GitHub repository for this paper, located at \url{https://github.com/barbagroup/jcs_paper_pinn/} and archived in Zenodo. 
If readers do not want to rerun the solutions, but still want to be able to re-create the figures, they may find raw data generated with the PINN solver and the traditional CFD solver in a separate Zenodo deposit.
